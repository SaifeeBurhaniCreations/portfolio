# SBC Deploy – Internal Deployment Platform Documentation

## Overview

SBC Deploy is an internal platform designed to streamline and simplify client app deployment. It provides clients with a temporary live environment under the `sbc-deploy.com` domain to test their applications, communicate with the development team, and finalize hosting needs before migrating to their own custom domain or subscribing to a managed plan.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

* **Subdomain-based client deployments**
* **Centralized reverse proxy for traffic management**
* **Managed DevOps (CI/CD, monitoring, auto-scaling)**
* **Temporary live hosting under sbc-deploy.com (1-month trial)**
* **Optional post-trial migration or managed hosting**

---

## 🌐 Subdomain Structure

### Unlimited Subdomain Support

* You can generate unlimited subdomains like:

  * `client1.sbc-deploy.com`
  * `staging.client2.sbc-deploy.com`
  * `demo-erp.sbc-deploy.com`

### Wildcard DNS Setup

To support unlimited subdomains:

* **DNS Record (A or CNAME)**:

  * `Type`: A or CNAME
  * `Host`: `*.sbc-deploy.com`
  * `Value`: Server IP or platform target

### HTTPS Support

* Use **Wildcard SSL certificate** (`*.sbc-deploy.com`), or
* Use **Let's Encrypt** with automated DNS challenge for each subdomain

---

## ⚙️ Technical Stack (Suggested)

* **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx or Traefik
* **App Hosting**: Docker + PM2 or Node.js native server
* **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
* **Monitoring**: Uptime Kuma / Grafana + Prometheus
* **Infrastructure**: VPS or cloud provider (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS, etc.)

---

## 📦 Tooling Example

### 1. Centralized Reverse Proxy

Handles routing:

* All subdomains point to the proxy
* Proxy forwards traffic to container or internal app based on subdomain

### 2. Deployment Controller

Script or UI to:

* Create containers or apps
* Assign subdomains
* Setup SSL
* Start monitoring

### 3. Auto Scaling (Optional Phase 2)

* Track traffic, CPU, memory
* Trigger scale-up/down events

---

## 📅 Trial Workflow (Client Perspective)

1. Client signs up for initial deployment
2. App is deployed under `client-name.sbc-deploy.com`
3. SBC manages hosting, CI/CD, scaling for 1 month
4. Client gives feedback and works with team
5. After trial:

   * Migrate to their own domain
   * Or subscribe to SBC's managed hosting plan

---

## 🔐 Security & Isolation

* All deployments are sandboxed (Docker, separate environments)
* HTTPS enforced
* API secrets stored per client
* Optional Basic Auth for staging environments

---

## 📈 Future Possibilities

* Client dashboard (logs, usage, status)
* Auto SSL + auto deploy from GitHub
* White-labeled version of SBC Deploy
* Developer portal with metrics and alerts

---

## 📞 Communication & Support

* Clients can request changes, scaling, or custom features during the trial
* Slack / Telegram / Email integration for live feedback loop

---

## 📘 Naming Suggestions

* `sbc-deploy.com` is good for MVP
* Consider renaming for productization (e.g., `LaunchPilot`, `QuickDeploy`, `AppNest`, etc.)

---

## ✅ Summary

SBC Deploy bridges the gap between development and production by offering a zero-hassle, short-term managed deployment solution. It's ideal for onboarding clients, showcasing MVPs, or providing proof-of-concept apps under a structured and scalable system.
